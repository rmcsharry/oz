Basherbots: Bashing Together Bots & Simulations

What: Basherbots is a project exploring the boundaries of AI-powered automation using pure Bash scripting. It leverages the simplicity and portability of Bash to create dynamic, interactive bots and simulations directly in the terminal.

Why: Basherbots embraces the philosophy that powerful tools don't have to be complex. By harnessing the ubiquity of Bash and the terminal, it aims to democratize access to AI-driven automation, even on resource-constrained devices.

Vision: The vision for Basherbots is to create a versatile framework for building:

Generative Agents: Bots that can interact with users, perform tasks, and create dynamic interfaces directly in the terminal.
Portable Simulations: Sandboxed environments that leverage Linux emulation to enable generative workflows with the filesystem as context.
Collaborative Human-AI Interfaces: Dynamic systems that combine the power of AI with the flexibility of the terminal and the filesystem to enable new forms of human-AI interaction.
Current Focus:

Pure Bash Bots: Bots are coded entirely in Bash, ensuring maximum portability and accessibility.
Curl & Tmux: Leverages these tools for API interaction and dynamic interface creation within the terminal.
Linux Emulation: Utilizes Linux emulation for portable, sandboxed simulations.
AI Integration: Integrates with AI models via APIs to enable generative tasks and intelligent interactions.
Future Goals:

Explore Performance Optimization: Potentially leverage assembly language or other techniques to enhance the performance of computationally intensive tasks.
Expand the Basherbots Ecosystem: Build a library of reusable modules and tools to accelerate development and encourage community contributions.
Empower Users: Enable users to easily create their own Basherbots and simulations, fostering a community of innovation and collaboration.
