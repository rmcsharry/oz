# Notes
- 0233 Could not sleep a wink, very wide awake and thinking about Basherbots lol, I can really feel the AGI. It's wild to me that I am just now discovering the terminal, although it's nice to have had all the experience with web etc. I can feel it in my bones that this is the path forward!

I'm not sure I want to use Twitter even though I understand the massive potential. I have had more meaningful things happening outside of socials, and I have been able to keep up just fine with the AI...even if I'm not super current I'm still locked into the scene through newsletters and youtube (which honestly, I feel like I have been learning/building/growing more by using 

I understand the spirit of emacs, but with llm wrapped nano/vim and tmux I think I can implement some spectacularly crazy bots. Everyone is thinking about Artifical General Intelligence but not enough people are thinking about artificial systems that are generally intelligent

Why shouldn't it be possible for me to create my own mixture of expert systems...I really really think I can do this. The models are getting good enough to recurse them perpetually or at least design "event-perpetuated loops"

I just don't know if I want to start a Twitter but I know the benefits of it. Perhaps I can try to automate Twitter, this way I can use it as an information agent and create my own newsletters. Same with Reddit, I'll curate my own social media usage and then try to design my own LLM algorithms


- 419 idea - Websim like service for json data, generative api for your basherbots `https://api.basherbots.com/simulation-url`
- 420 chat - Open source could likely overtake even if commercial is better because a human+AGI system is likely better than just a pure AGI system, and a network of humans + AGI is likely even better. So it could be that software companies will lose dominance in the encomy and social networks will become dominant. The stronger your network the more agency you have. But social media isn't necessarily a great place for networking for like, normal people. And there are way more normal people than "elite people", a AI gets better the difference between individual humans decreases but the human+AGI combo increases. So literally the stronger and more mutual the network the more agency and influenceyou have over your own reality. But that doesn't mean traditional wealth and status are the key, because you could be famous and everyone hates you lol, but if you have people in your life that are truly there for you and you for them, then through them you can be effective even in your worst times. So I think I get the meaning of partnerships and families in that sense. Now i just have to figure out how to impliment this insight. I make on average 3-10 real friends each year but I don't see those friendships through and they fade quickly...and that's without really trying for that, I can certainly develop my social skills and connections and try to focus on developing true genuine friendship. Like, I've made 10's of thousands of social media followers and 10's of thousands of github stars too, millions of views just organically so if I put serious effort of course I can succeed. 

- 1144 Whoo! I got much better sleep than I anticipated, I mean my sleep score was in the 50s lol but dang it's enough for me to be functional. Had I take a seroquel I would likely still be asleep and zombie until 3pm or so. Spent the morning doing branding for Basherbots, getting a Twitter and Reddit

I have:
  - chat.sh as a pure Bash script
  - bot.sh as a generative agent
  - sim.html to spin up Linux simulations

Next I will add:
  - ssh.html as a customizable javascript terminal
  - handsfree.js to control web handsfree (modernize the project)
  - handsfree.sh to control terminal handsfree
  - basherbots.apk to run all this on Android watches

Eventually ports for PowerShell, DOS, and other environments too

- 1206 idea - imagine a nano or vim plugin where whenever you press CTRL+ENTER it sends triggers a bash script, with the default being passing the document up to the cursor into ./chat and then outputting it back into editor...I explored this a few times with Markdown editors like Obsidian and Monaco Editor. I chat with Gemini a lot so this would let me store all the data here and play with it
