# Notes
- 1312 Late start to journaling! I was feeling anxious about starting to post on Twitter, but I decided to just go for it. I ended up posting a big twitter thread to set the tone for my account. I kinda acted too mopey and depressed in my last account so I don't expect a strong following at first, especially since I'm making pretty big claims without
- 1432 I feel both motivated and also depressed, my sleep has been terrible lately even with my sleep aids. I don't feel manic but I do feel extremely inspired to work on this project
- 1454 You know what I'm vibing, I don't need to feel bad for 420ing. I'm doing amazing research and I'm starting to find a rythm again. I of course will continue focus on moderating but the perspective will be more about moderating to focus more not because I feel bad about it :)
- 1532 Mapped basherbots.com earlier to the github page but the ?run=code doesn't pass over so I'll need to do that
- 1532 idea: create a bot that watches for ideas and adds them to the idea section
- 2246 Dang I forgot to commit in a while and lost some data...gotta train a bot to help with this
